.SH NAME
.B SHELLDON\fR \- minimal UNIX command interpreter
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B .hsh\fR 
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B Shelldon\fR is a simple UNIX command language interpreter capable of executing commands Interactivly from \fBSTDIN\fR or piped from 
a file.
It emulates basic functionality of the \fBsh\fR shell.
This man page borrows from the corresponding man pages sh(1) and dash(1).

.B Invocation
.in +2n
\fBShelldon\fR can be invoked both interactively and non-interactively.
If \fBShelldon\fR is invoked with standard input not connected to a terminal, it reads and executes received commands in order.

If \fBShelldon\fR is invoked with standard input connected to a terminal, an \fIinteractive\fR shell is opened.
When executing interactively, \fBShelldon\fR displays the prompt \fI$ \fR when it is ready to read a command.

if command line arguments are supplied upon invocation, \fBShelldon\fR treats the first argument as a file from which to read commands.
The supplied file should contain one command per line.
.B Shelldon\fR runs each of the commands contained in the file in order before exiting.
.in

.B Environment
.in +2n
Upon invocation, \fBShelldon\fR receives and copies the environment of the parent process in which it was exeucted.
This \fBenvironment\fR is an array of \fIname-value\fR strings describing variables in the format \fINAME=VALUE\fR.
.in

.B Command Execution
.in +2n
After receiving a command, \fBShelldon\fR split it into words using \fB" "\fR as a delimiter.
The first word is considered the command and all remaining words are considered arguments to that command.
.B Shelldon\fR then proceeds with the following actions:

.RS
1. the shell searches for the command in the list of shell builtins.
If it exists the function related to the builtin is executed.
.RE

.RS
2. if the first word is not a builtin, \fBShelldon\fR searches each element of the
\fBPATH\fR environmental variable for a directory containing an executable file by that name.
.RE

.RS
3. if nothing of the above searches was successful,
the shell executes the named program with any remaining arguments given in a separate execution environment.
.RE

.B Exit Status
.in +2n
.B Shelldon\fR returns the exit status of the last command executed, unless a syntax error occurs, with zero indicating success and non-zero indicating failure.

If a command is not found, the return status is 127; if a command is found but is not executable, the return status is 126.

All builtins return zero on success and one or two on incorrect usage (indicated by a corresponding error message).
.in

.B Signals
.in +2n
While running in interactive mode, \fBShelldon\fR ignores the keyboard input \fBCtrl+c\fR.
Alternatively, an input of end-of-file (\fBCtrl+d\fR) will exit the program.
.in

.B Shelldon Builtin Commands

.B cd
.RS
Usage: cd [DIRECTORY]

Changes the current directory of the process to \fBDIRECTORY\fR.

If no argument is given, the command is interpreted as \fBcd $HOME\fR.

.B exit
.RS
Usage: \fBexit [STATUS]\fR

Exits the shell.

The \fBSTATUS\fR argument is the integer used to exit the shell.

If no argument is given, the command is interpreted as \fBexit 0\fR.
.RE

.B env
.RS
Usage: \fBenv\fR

Prints the current environment.
.RE

.B help
.RS
Usage: \fBhelp [builtin_command]\fR

the help command will provide a list of available options to builtin commands

if no argument is given, help will display all possible options
.RS
